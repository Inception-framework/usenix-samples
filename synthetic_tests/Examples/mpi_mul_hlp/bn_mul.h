/*
 * gcc -O0 by default uses r7 for the frame pointer, so it complains about our
 * use of r7 below, unless -fomit-frame-pointer is passed. Unfortunately,
 * passing that option is not easy when building with yotta.
 *
 * On the other hand, -fomit-frame-pointer is implied by any -Ox options with
 * x !=0, which we can detect using __OPTIMIZE__ (which is also defined by
 * clang and armcc5 under the same conditions).
 *
 * So, only use the optimized assembly below for optimized build, which avoids
 * the build error and is pretty reasonable anyway.
